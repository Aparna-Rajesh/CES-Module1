### ESP Setup
![ESP Wiring](finalwiring.png)

1. Start by placing the ESP on your breadboard, ensuring that the header pins are already soldered to it.
2. Connect a 3V pin from the ESP to one of the positive (+) strips on your breadboard.
3. Similarly, connect a Ground (GND) pin from the ESP to one of the negative (-) strips on your breadboard.
4. Insert your potentiometer into the breadboard.
5. Connect the left pin of the potentiometer to the negative (-) strip, the middle pin to pin 36 on the ESP, and the right pin to the positive (+) strip.
6. Place your pushbutton on the breadboard.
7. Connect one of the pushbutton's top pins (either left or right) to the positive (+) strip and one of the bottom pins to pin 15 on the ESP.
8. Insert your joystick into the breadboard.
9. For the joystick wiring, connect the left-most pin to the negative (-) strip, the second pin from the left to the positive (+) strip, the VRX pin to pin 33 on the ESP, the VRY pin to pin 39 on the ESP, and the SW pin to pin 38 on the ESP.
10. Finally, plug your ESP into your computer, upload [the provided code](https://github.com/Aparna-Rajesh/CES-Modules/blob/main/Module%201/mod1_01.ino) to the microcontroller, and once it is running, execute [this code](https://github.com/Aparna-Rajesh/CES-Modules/blob/main/Module%201/mod1_01.ino) on your laptop.
